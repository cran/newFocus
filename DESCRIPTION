Title: True Discovery Guarantee by the New Focus Level Procedure
Version: 1.0
Date: 2020-07-09
Author: Ningning Xu
Maintainer: Ningning Xu <n.xu@lumc.nl>
Description: A new focus level procedure is developed based on the old focus level procedure of Goeman and Mansmann (2008) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btm628> and the closed testing procedure with globaltest of Xu and Goeman (2020) <arXiv:2001.01541>. It produces the lower bound for the number of true discoveries in any gene set or GO (Gene Ontology) term. It is more powerful for the focus level GO terms chosen by user before seeing the data than the non-focus level GO terms or gene sets chosen after seeing the data.
